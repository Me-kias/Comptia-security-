# 🔍 Gap Analysis in IT Security

## **What is a Gap Analysis?**
- Compares **where we are** vs **where we want to be**.  
- Helps identify **security weaknesses** and plan improvements.  
- Can be simple in concept but complex in practice.

---

## **Steps to Perform a Gap Analysis**

### 1. Establish a Baseline
- Provides a reference for desired security goals.  
- Common baselines:
  - **NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2** → Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  
  - **ISO/IEC 27001** → Information Security Management  
  - Custom baselines specific to your organization  

---

### 2. Evaluate People & Processes
- Check **skills and training** of staff  
- Review **security policies and procedures**  
- Assess how IT systems align with security goals  

---

### 3. Analyze Systems & Controls
- Compare existing systems against baseline requirements  
- Identify **weaknesses** and areas needing improvement  
- Break broad areas (like access control) into individual tasks:
  - User registration & deregistration  
  - Privileged access management  
  - Access reviews  

---

### 4. Create Gap Analysis Report
- Document **current state vs desired state** for each objective  
- Include a **roadmap** for improvement:
  - Time & budget needed  
  - Required equipment  
  - Change control steps  

---

### 5. Example Reporting
- Use **tables or charts** to summarize findings across locations:
  - Green → Close to baseline  
  - Yellow → Midway  
  - Red → Needs significant improvement  

- Prioritize improvements:
  1. Red areas first  
  2. Yellow areas next  
  3. Green areas last  

---

## **Goal**
- Provide a clear **plan to improve security posture**  
- Ensure all locations, systems, and processes align with chosen baselines  
- Document actionable recommendations for the organization
