# CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)

The **CIA Triad** is a simple way to remember the core principles of IT security.  
(You might also see it called the **AIC Triad**, but “CIA” is much easier to remember.  
This has *nothing* to do with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.)

The three parts of the triad are:

- **C – Confidentiality**  
- **I – Integrity**  
- **A – Availability**

These are usually shown as the three sides of a triangle, representing the main security goals of an organization.

## 🔹 Confidentiality
Confidentiality ensures that only the right people can access certain information.

### Common ways to provide confidentiality:
- **Encryption**  
  - Data is encrypted by the sender and decrypted by the receiver.  
  - Anyone who intercepts it can’t understand it.

- **Access controls**  
  - Users only access what they’re allowed to see.  
  - Example: Marketing can open marketing files, but not accounting files.

- **Authentication / MFA**  
  - Extra login factors (codes, biometrics, tokens) ensure only authorized users get in.

## 🔹 Integrity
Integrity ensures that the data received is exactly what was sent — untouched and unmodified.

### Methods to ensure integrity:
- **Hashing**  
  - Sender calculates a hash and sends it with the data.  
  - Receiver hashes the data again; if both match, the data is unchanged.

- **Digital signatures**  
  - Uses asymmetric encryption + hashing.  
  - Confirms both data integrity *and* the identity of the sender.

- **Certificates**  
  - Validate identities of users or devices during communication.

- **Nonrepudiation**  
  - The sender cannot deny sending the data because its integrity and origin are proven.

## 🔹 Availability
Availability ensures systems and data are accessible whenever needed.

### Ways to provide availability:
- **Fault tolerance / redundancy**  
  - Duplicate or backup systems take over if one fails.

- **System updates and patching**  
  - Keeps systems stable and secure, reducing downtime and vulnerabilities.

- **Proper management/monitoring**  
  - Ensures systems stay operational and issues are caught quickly.

These three principles—Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability—form the foundation of nearly all security strategies and decisions.
