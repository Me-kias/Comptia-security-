# 🔐 Nonrepudiation, Hashing & Digital Signatures (Quick Notes)

## ⭐ What Is Nonrepudiation?
Nonrepudiation means:
- You can prove **the data wasn’t changed** (integrity)
- You can prove **who actually sent it** (proof of origin)

Similar to signing a contract — your signature proves *you* signed it.

## 🔹 Integrity (Making Sure Data Wasn't Altered)
To check that data stays accurate and untouched, cryptography uses **hashing**.

### Hashing
- Creates a short “fingerprint” of the data  
- If *anything* changes (even one character), the hash becomes totally different  
- Used to verify downloaded files or transmitted data  

Example:  
If you hash a file, change 1 character, and hash it again → the new hash is completely different.

## 🔹 Proof of Origin (Who Sent the Data?)
Hashing alone can’t identify the sender.  
To link data to a specific person, we use **digital signatures**.

---

## 🔐 Digital Signatures (How We Prove Who Sent It)
Digital signatures use **asymmetric encryption**:

- Sender encrypts the hash using their **private key**
- Receiver decrypts using the sender’s **public key**

If both hashes match, the message:
- ✔ Didn’t change  
- ✔ Really came from the sender  
- ✔ Can’t be denied later → **nonrepudiation**

## 👥 Example: Alice → Bob

### 1. Alice sends a message:  
“You’re hired, Bob.”

### 2. What happens behind the scenes:
1. A hash of the message is created  
2. The hash is encrypted using **Alice’s private key** (this becomes the digital signature)  
3. Alice sends:
   - the plaintext message  
   - the encrypted hash (signature)

### 3. Bob receives it and verifies it:
1. Bob decrypts the signature using **Alice’s public key**  
2. He hashes the message himself  
3. Bob compares the two hashes  

**If they match → message is authentic and unmodified.**

## 📝 Summary
- **Hashing** → checks integrity  
- **Digital signatures** → checks identity + integrity  
- **Nonrepudiation** → sender can’t deny sending it  
- All of this normally happens automatically when you “add a digital signature”
